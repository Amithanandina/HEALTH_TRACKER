# HEALTH_TRACKER
This is Data structure and algorithms project in c language which is a simple and where inputs are give through file function.
## Problem statement
Now a days it doesn’t matter with what age are you or how fit are you or what diet do you follow to get any heath issues, a person can collapse at any moment.
One of the reasons for this is he/she couldn’t reach the hospital or contact the doctor on time. So to overcome this problem we have come up with an idea called health tracker.
This health tracker calculates the pulse rate and compare it with the normal range of pulse rate and if it doesn’t be within the range then track the location of the patient and find the nearest hospital and acknowledge him/her by sending an alert message with the hospital address but if patient is in worst condition that he/she cannot go to hospital then hospital will get an alert message with the patients live location so that hospital can send ambulance to him/her. 
## Points to be considered
1. To find the nearest hospital for the patient to get treatment on the basis of low pulse rate, high blood pressure or low blood pressure.
   Algorithms used: Dijkstra’s Algorithm
2. This is for the ambulance to find the shortest path to the patient’s location.
   Algorithms used: Floyd Wars hall's algorithm
3. This is to check whether the hospital has some vacancy.
   Algorithm used:Quick sort and Merge sort
   
  ### Now let's crack this!
